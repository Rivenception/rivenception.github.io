# Uconn Full Stack Boot Camp: Rick Mingione 

This site will serve as my portfolio as a progress through a 6mo intensive full stack boot camp support by Uconn.

## About me

```
I am currently a Sr. Program Manager with an airline seating company based in Torrington, CT. I've always had an interest in how things work and debate. Those interests lead me to a dual B.A. in Economics and Philosophy.  While studying philosophy in college I found a modal logic class that absolutely fascinated me. Fast-forward a few years and I started dabbling with codeacademy.com and trying to learn code on my own as it closely resembled the logic structures I enjoyed from Modal Logic in college. I am now looking to delve further down the proverbial rabbit hole into what I hope to be a new and fulfilling career.

## Goals

```
I have many aspirations and desires following this course.  I hope to expand my portfolio and market myself towards freelance work and possibly my own business.  Additionally, I hope to use the knowledge I attain to set up passive income streams for myself to further my objective of self-employment.

## Credits

A big credit goes to my instructors in this course.  Without them this README would not exist and I would not be embarking on this directive.
